#     Javascript Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.Functions are the basic building block of JavaScript. Functions allow us to encapsulate a block of code and reuse it multiple times. Functions make JavaScript code more readable, organized, reusable, and maintainable.


# What is a JavaScript Function?

A JavaScript function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Functions allow developers to encapsulate logic, making code more organized, readable, and maintainable. They serve as black boxes that take inputs, process them, and return outputs. Functions are essential for breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.

# Function Syntax
In JavaScript, you can declare a function using the function keyword, followed by the function name, a set of parentheses for parameters, and curly braces for the function body. Here's a basic function declaration:
           
           function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);

};

In this example, greet is the function name, and it takes a parameter name. When called, it logs a greeting message with the provided name.

#  Function Types
JavaScript functions come in various forms, including:

1.Named Functions: The example above is a named function. They have a specific name and are often defined globally, making them accessible from anywhere in your code.

2.Anonymous Functions: Anonymous functions, also known as function expressions, don't have a name. They are typically assigned to a variable or used as arguments for other functions. Here's an example:
            const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

add(3, 5);

3.Arrow Functions: Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions, especially when they are simple one-liners. Here's an example of an arrow function

4.Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE): IIFE is a self-invoking anonymous function. It's often used to create a private scope for variables to avoid polluting the global scope. Example:
